### Set up variables
cpuScore = 0

### Start game loop

  ### Validate input
  while True:

  ### Generate computer pick
  computerHand = random.choice(possibleHands)

  ### Print results
  print("Your hand: ", playerHand)
  print("Cpu hand: ", computerHand)
  result = checkForWinner(playerHand, computerHand)
  if(result == "Player"):
    playerScore += 1
  elif(result == "Cpu"):
